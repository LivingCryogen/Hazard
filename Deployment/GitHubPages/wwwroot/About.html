            <p class="indented-p"> Hi! I'm Josh McKnight. I'm an aspiring software developer. </p>
            <p class="indented-p">
                I'm proud to present <i>Hazard!: Nothing ventured, nothing gained</i>, a local, "hot-seat" game for two to six players vying for military control of the globe.
                And thanks to the art of my lovely wife, Kiah, players can collect cards with some real charm!
