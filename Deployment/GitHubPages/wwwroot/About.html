            <p class="indented-p"> Hi! I'm Josh McKnight, an aspiring software developer. </p>
            <p class="indented-p">
                I'm proud to present <i>Hazard!: Nothing ventured, nothing gained</i>, a local, "hot-seat" game for two to six players who vie for military control of the globe.
