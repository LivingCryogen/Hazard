        Hi. I'm Josh McKnight, an aspiring software developer. And this is my first portfolio project site!

        <i>Hazard!</i> is a local, "hot-seat" game for two to six players developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Deployed as an MSIX
        package (.msixbundle), Windows users may download and run the application by clicking the appropriate button above. For installation details,
        click "Download"<br /><br />
    </p>
    <p class="indented-p">
        For full details on the project, browse the other subsections of this site and check out the github repository ('Repo').
