                <p class="indented-p">
                    I'm proud to present <i>Hazard!: Nothing ventured, nothing gained</i>, a local, "hot-seat" game for two to six players who vie for military control of the globe.

            In high school I had one programming project I could never get fully working: a "Risk" clone in VB6.
            When I decided to return to software development, I figured I should finish what I had started.
            Of course, VB6 wouldn't serve any more. The program would have to be written in a contemporary language, conform
            to modern industry standards and practices, and leverage current technologies. Hopefully, developing
            it would also begin to teach me how to work within a team.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-p">This is that project.</p>
