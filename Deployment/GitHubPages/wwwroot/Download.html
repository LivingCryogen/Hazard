    <p class="indented-p">
        Hazard! deploys via an MSIX packager. Your download should be a single .msixbundle file. On opening, you should see: 
    </p>
    
    <img class="download-pic" src="Images/Install.jpg" alt="What the installation window should look like." />
    
    <p class="indented-p">
        Note the publisher name (should be "Joshua McKnight") and the source ("livingcryogen.github.io").
    </p>
    
    <p class="indented-p">
        Installation may require access to the download source, <i>which is time-limited</i>. If too much time has passed, try 
        redownloading and installing immediately. Take care: <b>excessive requests may result in rate-limiting or IP bans.</b>
    </p>
    
    <p class="indented-p">The files are signed by me, "Joshua McKnight," via Microsoft's Azure Trusted Signing. To verify, and you may right-click
        the installation bundle, select "Properties" -> "Digital Signatures."
