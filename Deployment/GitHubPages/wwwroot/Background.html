    In high school -- far too long ago -- there was one programming project I never got working: a "Risk" clone in VB6.
    I figured that my first business after turning back to software would be to try and finish what I had started then.
    Of course, VB6 wouldn't serve any more. The program would have to be written in a contemporary language, follow
    modern industry standards and practices, and use current technologies. And it would need to demonstrate that I could
    build something as part of a team.
    <p class="indented-p">This is that project.</p>
