# Hazard!
*Hazard!* is a working "hot-seat" (local only) board game playable by two to six players based on the popular board game *Risk* (owned by Hasbro, Inc). It is written entirely in C#, with the exception of the WPF UI which relies mostly on XAML.

*Hazard!* emulates basic game mechanics and rules from *Risk: The Game of Global Domination* by Hasbro, Inc.

## Purpose
As a software development portfolio project, Hazard has two primary purposes:
  1. To force learning on me, its sole developer.
  2. To demonstrate those learned skills.

As a corrollary, it also aims at contemporary, professional industry standards in the
1. Writing
2. Testing
3. Documentation, and
4. Organization/Architecture of code.

This means it is intentionally "over-engineered": I took on the project ***as if* it were to be extended and worked on by teams** in a modern development environment. 
See the "Architecture" and "Feature Highlights" sections for more details.

If anyone has some fun or is charmed by my wife's art, then the project has achieved beyond its goals! :)

## Background
This is my first programming project after deciding to return to IT. When choosing my first portfolio project, I remembered a high school Visual Basic project I never got working that was to emulate Hasbro's *Risk*. I decided to achieve that early goal, but updated to use modern languages, frameworks, and other technologies.

Discovering which languages and tools would be used today on the project left unfinished twenty years ago, I landed on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Fortunately, Microsoft's C# and the .NET
ecosystem has developed a great deal since the Visual Basic days. In retrospect, this decision did narrow the initial focus to desktop development, but I also discovered that MVVM was widely used
in web contexts as well (and much more so, it's close cousin MVC), so it appears that the focus might progress naturally to a wider and/or web context in the medium to long term.
