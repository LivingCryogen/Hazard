# Hazard!
*Hazard!* is a working "hot-seat" (local only) board game playable by two to six players. It is based on the popular board game *Risk* (owned by Hasbro, Inc).

## Purpose
As a software development project, Hazard has two primary purposes:
  1. To force me, its sole developer, to learn.
  2. To demonstrate my learned skills.

As a corrollary, it also aims at high industry standards in the writing, testing, documenting, and organizing of code.
Consequently, it is "over-engineered": I took on the project *as if* it were to be extended and worked on by teams in a modern
development environment. See the "Architecture" and "Feature Highlights" sections for more details.

## Background
This is my first programming project after deciding to return to IT. When deciding what my first portfolio project should be, I remembered
a high school Visual Basic project I never got working that was to emulate Hasbro's *Risk*. I decided to achieve that early goal, but
updated, to use modern languages, frameworks, and other technologies.
