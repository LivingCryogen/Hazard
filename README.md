## Purpose
As a software development project, Hazard has two primary purposes:
  1. To force learning on me, its sole developer.
  2. To demonstrate those learned skills.

As a corrollary, it also aims at contemporary, professional industry standards in the
1. Writing
2. Testing
3. Documentation, and
4. Organization/Architecture of code.
  This means it is intentionally "over-engineered": 
I took on the project ***as if* it were to be extended and worked on by teams** in a modern development environment. 
See the "Architecture" and "Feature Highlights" sections for more details.

Along the way, if anybody has a little fun or is charmed by my wife's artwork, all the better. :)

## Background
This is my first programming project after deciding to return to IT. When deciding what my first portfolio project should be, I remembered
a high school Visual Basic project I never got working that was to emulate Hasbro's *Risk*. I decided to achieve that early goal, but
updated, to use modern languages, frameworks, and other technologies.
