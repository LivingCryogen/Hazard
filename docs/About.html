    <h3>About <i>Hazard!</i></h3>

    <div class="about-section">
        <p class="indented-p">
            <i>Hazard!: Nothing ventured, nothing gained</i> is a strategic conquest game for two to six players who vie for military control of the globe. 
        <p class="indented-p">And thanks to art by my wife, Kiah, you get a touch of charm with your campaign!</p>
        <p class="indented-p"><i>Hazard!</i> was developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and deployed as an MSIX package (.msixbundle). Windows users can get the application by clicking the download button.</p>
        <p class="indented-p"><i>Hazard!</i> emulates a popular board game's ruleset. See the "Help" and "About" sections of the application menu after installation.</p>

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p class="indented-p">
            In high school, I had one programming project I could never get fully working: a "Risk" clone in VB6.
            When I decided to pivot back to software development, I figured I should finish what I had started.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-p">
            Of course, VB6 wouldn't serve any more. The program would have to be written in a contemporary language,
            conform to modern industry standards and practices, and leverage current technologies. Hopefully, developing
            it would also teach me something about how to work within a team.
        </p>
        <p class="indented-p" style="margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: bold; color: #31c1cc;">
            This is that project, now evolved into a software engineering showcase!
