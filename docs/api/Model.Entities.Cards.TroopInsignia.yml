  summary: Serves as any insignia.
  remarks: >-
    The default card set requires sets of three cards in two possible combinations: 3 identical insignia, or 3 different insignia. <br />

    A single wild will guarantee a three card set within five cards. see <xref href="Model.Entities.Cards.TroopCardSet.IsValidTrade(Shared.Interfaces.Model.ICard%5b%5d)" data-throw-if-not-resolved="false"></xref>.
