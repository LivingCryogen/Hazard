    In high school I had one programming project I could never get fully working: a "Risk" clone in VB6.
    When I decided to return to software development, I figured I should finish what I had started.
    Of course, VB6 wouldn't serve any more. The program would have to be written in a contemporary language, conform
    to modern industry standards and practices, and leverage current technologies. Hopefully, developing
    it would also begin to teach me how to work within a team.
    <p class="indented-p">This is that project.</p>
